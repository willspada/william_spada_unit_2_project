> Unit 2, Project 2

---

You will complete a series of exercises exploring [the top-rated movies on IMDB](./data/imdb_1000.csv), an online database of film info and reviews.

## Project Requirements

Create working solutions for all of the relevant questions in `imdb.ipynb`. Include comments that explain any non-obvious choices or assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.

**Bonus 1**: In programming (and life), there may be multiple ways to solve a problem. After completing our challenges, go back and see if you can think of any other valid methods.

**Bonus 2**: Complete the `chipotle.ipynb` exercises as well. The instructions in this notebook prompt you to use built-in Python tools rather than `pandas`. You may use `pandas` instead if you wish.

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Surpasses our wildest expectations!_

> Note: Scores of `2` mean that a requirement has been completely fulfilled, while `3` is typically reserved for bonus objectives.
